# PowerShell Library <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/assets/Powershell_256.png" alt="PowerShell Logo" align="right" width="225"/>

A library of open-source [MIT][license]-licensed [PowerShell][powershell] scripts written and maintained by `FMJ Studios` for use with [PowerShell][powershell] Version 6 and above. Refer to Microsoft's in-depth [PowerShell Documentation][powershell_docs] for more information on how these scripts work. Scripts meant for direct execution by the user, an init system or other means of automation are located in the [`scripts`](scripts) directory. The [`lib`](lib) directory contains library scripts meant to be re-used across files or even different repositories with things like [Git Submodules][git_submodules] or _contrib_ scripts like [git_subtree]. You may of course take a look at other repositories of ours for tips on how to achieve re-use.

## ‚ú® TL;DR

```pwsh
help ./scripts/move-regex.ps1 # Outputs the script documentation
